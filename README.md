# MICB475_25W1_Team_10
This repository contains weekly **meeting agendas and minutes** for **Team 10** in UJEMI Project 2 (MICB475).
Agendas are posted before each meeting for mentor review, and minutes are added to record key discussions, decisions, and next steps.  
Team members will alternate responsibility for maintaining these records to ensure consistent tracking of project progress.

## Weekly Records
### Week 1 (02-Oct-2025)
#### Agenda
* Potential datasets of interest: #11 (Anemia), #14 (Diabetes), #18 (Vaping and Smoking), #24 (Gastric cancer)
* Present possible research questions and discuss with TA
* Ensure all members have access to the team’s GitHub repository<br/><br/> 

#### Meeting Minutes
Approved Ideas (✅):
- **Smoking and vaping** dataset (#18): Ethnic differences in the USA between smoking (=vaping) populations (Caucasian vs. non-Caucasian) 
  - **Main factors of interest (3):**  
      1. Sample location  
      2. Ethnicity  
      3. Smoker vs. non-smoker  
   - **Proposed workflow:**
     - Categorize by sample location and compare between locations
     - Within each location, analyze ethnicity
     - Conduct functional analysis (i.e., gender comparisons) only *after narrowing locations where clear differences are observed* <br/><br/>
    
Not Approved / Rejected Ideas (❌):
- **Anemia** dataset (#11):
  - gender comparison 
  - diet comparison  
  - comparison of different months 

- **Smoking and vaping** dataset (#18): 
  - comparison between geographical locations, but some with a limited sample size and fewer annotations
  - Different sample sources (fecal vs. oral) 
  - Population study (cohort vs. cohort comparison) by combining all datasets, focusing only on e-cigarette ✅ (backup plan)
  - compare ethnicity in the UK (limited representation) 

- **Diabetes** dataset (#14):
  - both datasets are Texas-based. The "Mexican" dataset was conducted in Mexico. 
  - BMI and diabetes X
  - Look more in depth into the dataset: Does diabetes influence bacterial pathway enrichment versus depletion?
  - Functional analyses (e.g., comparison between genders)
    
- **Gastric cancer** dataset (#24):
  - Most significant difference is between gastric cancer vs. healthy
  - Comparison of different subtype histopathologies   
  
- **Alcohol consumption** database (#22):
  - alcohol consumption vs BMI<br/><br/>    
 
#### Action items
- add TA Ritu onto the repository and the team #
- explore the USA_Smoking_Datasets
- look into literature to search for additional smoking/microbiome datasets with additional ethnicity (by tomorrow 03-Oct-24)
