# MICB475_25W1_Team_10
This repository contains weekly **meeting agendas and minutes** for **Team 10** in UJEMI Project 2 (MICB475).
Agendas are posted before each meeting for mentor review, and minutes are added to record key discussions, decisions, and next steps.  
Team members will alternate responsibility for maintaining these records to ensure consistent tracking of project progress.

## Weekly Records
### Week 1 (02-Oct-2025)
**Agenda:**
* Potential datasets of interest: #11, #14, #18, #24
* Brainstorm possible research questions and discuss with TA
* Ensure all members have access to the teamâ€™s GitHub repository

**Meeting Minutes:**
##### Project Question Ideas: #####
- Anemia dataset:
  - gender X
  - diet X
  - comparison of different months X
  
- Gastric cancer dataset:
  - comparison of different subtype histopathologies (the most significant difference is between gastric cancer and healthy) X
  
- Smoking and vaping: 
  - limited sample size and fewer annotations
  - comparison between geographical locations
  - different sample (fecal vs. oral) X
  - population study (cohort vs. cohort comparison) by combining all datasets by focusing on only e-cigarette Y
  - compare ethnicity in the UK (limited representation) or
  - ethnic differences in the USA between smoking (=vaping) Caucasian vs. non-Caucasian Y 
    - categorize into different sample locations
    - bin everything into each dataset and compare between locations
    - Focusing on 3 factors: 
      - Sample location
      - Ethnicity-based
      - Smoker or not?
    - Workflow: categorized into different sample locations > within each sample location > analyze the ethnicity within each sample > Functional analysis 
    - Functional analysis (i.e, comparison between genders) is only done after the team narrows down locations where we see differences.
   
- Diabetes:
  - both datasets are Texas-based. The "Mexican" dataset was conducted in Mexico. 
  - BMI and diabetes X
  - Look more in depth into the dataset: Does diabetes influence bacterial pathway enrichment versus depletion?
  - Functional analyses (e.g., comparison between genders) 

- Alcohol:
  - alcohol consumption vs BMI
 

##### Action items: #####
- add TA Ritu onto the repository and the team #
- explore the USA_Smoking_Datasets
- look into literature to search for additional smoking/microbiome datasets with additional ethnicity (by tomorrow 03-Oct-24)
